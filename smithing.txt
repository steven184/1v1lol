Since the original game is made in Unity, we can develop a similar game using Phaser 3 and Three.js for 3D graphics. Key Features to Include Multiplayer (Socket.io) – Real-time PvP gameplay. Shooting Mechanics – Players can aim and shoot. Building Mechanics – Simple structure placement (walls, ramps). Player Movement – Smooth FPS/TPS controls. Weapon System – Switching between guns and build tools. Firebase Authentication – For login & matchmaking. Tech Stack Phaser 3 – Game engine for 2D/3D gameplay. Three.js – For rendering 3D environments. Socket.io – Multiplayer support. Firebase – For authentication & database storage. Plan Set Up a Basic Game Scene – A 3D world where players can move. Implement Player Controls – WASD for movement, Mouse for aiming. Add Shooting Mechanics – Gun firing, bullets, and damage. Build Mode – Players can place walls and ramps. Multiplayer Support – Real-time communication with Socket.io. Authentication & Matchmaking – Firebase for storing user data. Next Steps Do you want a 2D top-down version using Phaser, or a full 3D version using Three.js? Should I generate assets like player models, weapons, and environment using AI (DALL·E)? Do you need Firebase integration for login/matchmaking? Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🚀 2025-03-11 16:42:59 Copy You full 3d 2025-03-11 16:43:23 YesChatGameMakerGPT Awesome! We'll build a full 3D multiplayer game similar to 1v1.lol using Three.js for rendering and Socket.io for multiplayer. Here’s how we’ll proceed: Tech Stack Three.js → 3D rendering engine Cannon.js → Physics (collisions, gravity) Socket.io → Real-time multiplayer Firebase → User authentication & matchmaking Node.js + Express → Backend for server logic WebRTC / Peer.js (optional) → Voice chat Game Features 1️⃣ Player Movement (WASD + Mouse) First/third-person view. Smooth camera & movement mechanics. 2️⃣ Shooting System Weapon switching (AR, Shotgun, Sniper). Ammo system + reloading. 3️⃣ Building Mechanics Place walls, ramps, floors.
